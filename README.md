# SMLogging (Service Model Logging)

This library provides request and error logging behaviors for Windows Communication Foundation (WCF / Service Model) services.  While WCF has builting logging features, this libary is intended to provide simple, consumable log files rather than the bulky traces produced by the built in features.  Think of it as IIS request logging for WCF services (including net.pipe and net.tcp traffic in addition to http).
